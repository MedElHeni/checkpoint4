                     <h1><strong>Gender Equality in the Workplace Starts with Company Culture [+Infographic]</strong></h1>
                      <p>For those of you that have read my past blogs, you probably know that I am passionate about making a difference in the world around me and being a voice for change where change is needed.

                      From the comments I’ve received from readers, I’m thrilled to say many of you share that passion.

                      An issue that has meant a lot to me for some time has been gender equality, both in the workplace and in general.

                      To give you a little background, I started my career working on TV shows in Hollywood… well, technically Burbank.

                      For anyone who has followed the news for the past year, you’ve heard stories about what it has historically been like to be a woman in Hollywood.

                      I saw a lot of people working for inclusive and equal environments, of course, but I also certainly saw my fair share of unfair treatment.

                      Some of my less positive experiences proved to be valuable learning opportunities. They made me take it  upon myself to become more informed, learn how to                       measure my self worth, and build up the courage to fight for equal treatment.

                      So, when I recently came across <a href="#">this infographic from Accenture</a>, it got me thinking about all of my past and present experiences with gender                       equality, or inequality, in the workplace..</p>
